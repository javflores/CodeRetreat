# Rules of Conway's Game of Life

For every cell in the universe:

### Under-population: 
Any cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies

### Survive:
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on the next generation

### Overcrowding:
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies

### Reproduction: 
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell
